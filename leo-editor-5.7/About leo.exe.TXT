leo.exe contains everything you need to run Leo on Windows without
installing *anything* else. It contains all needed libraries, including
Python itself, PyQt, pylint and other packages. It also contains many data
files, including Leo's source code and various .leo files.

Notes:

1. leo.exe was created by PyInstaller: http://pythonhosted.org/PyInstaller

2. Before Leo starts, PyInstaller unpacks all libraries and data files to a
   temp folder: ~\AppData\Local\Temp\_MEInnn. As a result, starting leo.exe
   is slower than usual.

3. *Warning*: You can open Leo files from the "Files:Open Leo File" menu,
   but these files will be in the temp folder. They will be *destroyed*
   when you exit leo.exe. If you want to do real work with Leo you must
   create .leo files in a permanent folder on your machine.
